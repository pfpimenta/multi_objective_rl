# multi_objective_rl
NetLogo implementation of a multiagents system with multi-objective reinforcement learning using ensemble techniques.

This project is an assignment of the autonomous agents and multi-agent system (AA&MAS) class (INF05019) of 2021/1 ministered by Prof. Ana LÃºcia C. Bazzan at UFRGS.

The main goal of the project is to reproduce the results of the following article:

> Brys, Tim & Taylor, Matthew & Nowe, Ann. (2014). *Using Ensemble
> Techniques and Multi-Objectivization to Solve Reinforcement Learning
> Problems*. 263. 10.3233/978-1-61499-419-0-981.

To run the code, you will need to install NetLogo and load the .nlogo file. Then, you may set the parameters (n, exploration_rate, is_training) in the visual interface however you which, click on the **setup** button to setup the simulated environment, and then on the **go** button to start/pause the simulation.
